This mod is a request by my mate for bringing pre-9.8 player profile UI. But along with that the mod also corrects UI in some places:
- Account creation date displaying in your own profile
- Ability to navigate during profile background preview
- Removal of unnecessary elements (header) and empty spaces
- Bringing "Message" button to own profile. Given that, you can write to yourself, add yourself to friends and even add yourself to blacklist! I haven't seen more any interesting interactions yet.

Compatibility:
- Platform: any
- Game publisher: any
- Game version: any
- Game version tested against: 10.0
